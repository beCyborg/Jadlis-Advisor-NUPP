# NUP1: Prefer Results and Truth to Affiliations

## Context

Read this file when the NUP Scan flags NUP1 as Yellow or Red, or when the user's situation involves any of the following:

- A methodology debate is consuming team energy (Agile vs Waterfall, Scrum vs Kanban, PRINCE2 vs PMBOK)
- Team members identify themselves AS a methodology rather than using it as a tool
- Resistance to ideas from outside the team's adopted methodology
- Evaluation of which PM approach to adopt
- A professional is dismissing another's input based on certification, background, or method affiliation
- The team is stuck because they cannot agree on approach and the debate is blocking progress

This reference gives Claude the NUPP-specific diagnostic framework for affiliation bias. Claude's general training covers tribalism conceptually but does not include the NUPP diagnostic patterns for identifying and correcting it in project contexts specifically.

## The Principle

NUP1 states: **Prefer results and the truth to affiliations.**

In project work, "affiliations" are loyalties to methodologies, certifications, tools, schools of thought, or professional tribes. These affiliations provide a sense of belonging and identity, which is a legitimate human need — but when that identity becomes more important than the results the project is meant to deliver, it becomes a project pathology.

The practical consequence: a team or manager whose PM identity is tied to a specific methodology will resist accurate diagnosis when the diagnosis suggests that methodology is a poor fit. They will interpret valid critique of their approach as an attack on their identity. They will dismiss useful practices from other methods because those practices "belong to the other camp." They will continue applying a method that is producing poor results rather than admit the method is mismatched, because changing course would require admitting error.

This is not a personality flaw — it is a structural problem. When membership in a professional tribe is more socially rewarding than learning across tribal boundaries, tribalism becomes the rational choice for individuals even as it damages collective project outcomes.

NUP1 is the corrective: results and truth come first. Affiliations are acceptable as labels for approaches — not as identity.

## Method Tribalism

### Definition

Method tribalism is the pattern where a PM methodology stops being a tool and becomes a group identity. Members of the group define themselves by the method ("I am Agile"), enforce orthodoxy within the group, and treat outsiders — both those using different methods and those questioning practices — as wrong by definition rather than by evidence.

The diagnostic test is simple: can the practitioner articulate a specific project type where their preferred methodology would be a poor choice? A tool user can answer this immediately. A tribal member cannot, or gives a vague answer that always concludes with their method being correct once you understand it properly.

### The Agile–Waterfall War

The most visible instance of method tribalism in modern project management is the Agile-versus-Waterfall conflict. Its development followed a recognizable pattern:

**Stage 1 — Early adoption.** Agile methods emerged from genuine frustration with over-planned, rigidly controlled software projects that delivered late, wrong, or not at all. The early Agile Manifesto signatories were practitioners documenting what was actually working. Their critique of heavyweight predictive approaches was evidence-based and specific to a particular domain: complex software development with unclear requirements.

**Stage 2 — Community formation.** Practitioners who found Agile methods effective formed communities, developed training and certification, and created professional identities around the approach. This is natural and useful — shared vocabulary, peer learning, and recognized expertise accelerate adoption of genuinely good ideas.

**Stage 3 — Cult dynamics.** As communities scaled, belonging to the Agile community became socially valuable independent of results. "Being Agile" became a marker of being modern, flexible, and professional. Waterfall became a marker of being outdated, rigid, and wrong. The original evidence-based argument — these approaches work better for uncertain-requirement software projects — got replaced by a simpler identity-based argument: Agile good, Waterfall bad.

**Stage 4 — Blocks to learning.** Once tribal identity is established, several learning pathways close simultaneously. Agile practitioners stop examining evidence that predictive approaches outperform iterative ones in certain contexts (construction, hardware development, regulatory environments, projects with stable requirements). Waterfall practitioners stop examining evidence that iterative approaches handle uncertainty better. Both groups spend energy on the debate rather than on analyzing their actual project situations.

The result: professionals who are worse at project diagnosis than they would be without the tribal identity, because the diagnosis is filtered through "which side are they on" rather than "what does this specific project need."

Real professionals — those whose identity is tied to delivering results rather than to a methodology — do not experience this conflict. They ask: what does this project need? The answer sometimes points toward predictive planning, sometimes toward iterative development, usually toward a specific combination. **There is no Agile-waterfall war for real professionals.**

### PRINCE2 vs PMBOK Geographic Tribalism

A different form of method tribalism operates along geographic lines. PRINCE2 is dominant in the UK, Europe, Australia, and many Commonwealth countries. PMBOK (and the PMP certification) dominates in North America. Practitioners in each region often treat their regional standard as superior, not on the basis of evidence about project outcomes, but on the basis of familiarity and professional network effects.

This is association by location, not by merit. A PRINCE2 Practitioner who dismisses PMP-holders as lacking real governance knowledge, or a PMP who dismisses PRINCE2 as bureaucratic and rigid, is exhibiting geographic tribalism: they are drawing conclusions about tool quality from information about regional distribution, which tells you nothing about whether the tool works for a specific project context.

The NUPP view: PRINCE2 and PMBOK both capture real, validated knowledge about managing projects. They emphasize different things, organize knowledge differently, and emerged from different professional traditions. Both have genuine strengths. Both have documented weaknesses. The question is always fit for context, not which certification body is superior.

### How Tribalism Damages Projects

Four concrete mechanisms:

**Blocks learning from outsiders.** If practices from "the other camp" are presumed wrong, the team cannot evaluate them on merit. A Scrum team that dismisses the PRINCE2 Business Case concept as "too bureaucratic" without examining its purpose misses a legitimate tool for project sponsorship alignment. A PRINCE2 shop that dismisses Retrospectives as "Agile fluff" loses a structured mechanism for process improvement.

**Discourages outsiders from learning from the group.** When tribal identity is visible, outsiders from other methodologies approach with defensiveness rather than curiosity. Knowledge transfer across methodological communities becomes socially costly, which means it happens less frequently.

**Makes belonging more important than results.** When a methodology is producing poor outcomes for a specific project, the tribal member's social risk in admitting this is high — it reads as disloyalty. The path of least resistance is to continue the methodology and attribute poor results to external causes (bad requirements, inadequate sponsorship, uncooperative stakeholders) rather than to method-context mismatch.

**Prevents understanding the real meaning of the approach.** The Agile Manifesto values are specific and nuanced. "Responding to change over following a plan" does not mean "no planning." "Working software over comprehensive documentation" does not mean "no documentation." When a methodology becomes tribal identity, practitioners often hold a simplified, performative version of it rather than the substantive original. They do the rituals without understanding the rationale.

### The Correct Relationship to Methodology

Use methodology labels for approaches, not for identity.

"I am Agile" is an identity statement. It means: my professional self-worth, my community membership, and my way of seeing projects are bound to this approach.

"I use Agile approaches" is a tool statement. It means: for this class of project, iterative methods have worked well in my experience, so I use them, while remaining open to evidence that this project is different.

The practical test: can you complete the sentence "I use Agile approaches, but there are projects where I'd recommend predictive planning because..." with a specific, evidence-based answer? If yes, you are using a tool. If the sentence doesn't make sense to you, examine whether an affiliation is operating.

## Continuous Learning

Affiliations address a real human need: the need for belonging, community, and a stable professional identity. NUP1 does not deny this need or demand that practitioners be identity-free. It addresses what happens to that need when the affiliation is the primary source of professional identity.

When affiliation provides identity, continuous learning becomes threatening. New information from outside the tribe challenges the tribe's worldview. New information from inside the tribe — critique, retrospection, failure analysis — challenges individual standing. Learning slows because the social cost of learning (admitting what you don't know, changing your views, incorporating insights from outsiders) is higher than the cost of staying still.

The NUPP prescription: when you step back from affiliation-as-identity, fill the resulting gap with continuous learning. Make learning the identity, not the methodology. The professional who says "I am always learning about how to deliver better project outcomes" cannot be made tribal, because every new idea is welcome data rather than a threat.

A concrete implication: **what we believe today is merely our best understanding so far.** This applies to NUPP itself. If the core NUPP principles have not changed in years — if no new evidence, no practitioner feedback, no project postmortems have modified anything — that is a warning sign, not a sign of solidity. Principles that don't evolve as evidence accumulates are probably protecting themselves from evidence rather than responding to it.

This creates a self-applicable test for NUPP: use it as a tool. If it produces better project diagnoses and recommendations than the alternative, continue using it. If you find cases where it consistently fails or misleads, note them and feed that back. If NUPP itself were to become a tribal affiliation — if practitioners said "I am NUPP" instead of "I use NUPP as a diagnostic framework" — that would be a NUP1 violation at the meta-level.

## Openness Protocol

NUP1 has behavioral implications for how disagreements are conducted in project teams. Two roles: the person objecting, and the person receiving the objection.

### When You Are Objecting

Aim at the idea, not the person. "This approach has a problem: it assumes stable requirements, but our requirements have changed twice in three weeks" is aimed at the idea. "You're always recommending waterfall approaches and ignoring the realities of modern software development" is aimed at the person.

The practical test: could the person incorporate your objection without changing who they are? If yes, you aimed at the idea. If incorporating your objection requires them to admit being fundamentally wrong as a professional, you aimed at the person.

Idea-aimed objections can be evaluated on merit and incorporated or rebutted with evidence. Person-aimed objections trigger defensiveness and identity protection — they make the conversation about winning and losing rather than about finding the best approach.

### When You Are Receiving an Objection

Interpret it as a discussion of ideas, not as an attack on you. Even if the objection is clumsily worded or comes from a tribal source, the underlying substantive point may be valid. Extract the idea from the delivery.

Do not listen to respond — listen to understand. The failure mode is processing an objection while simultaneously constructing a rebuttal, without genuinely considering whether the objection might be correct. The listener who is already composing their response has stopped evaluating the incoming information.

Work with the other person to improve the idea. The goal of the exchange is a better approach, not a won argument. If their objection identifies a real weakness, the right response is "you're right about that — how do we address it?" not "but on the other hand..."

### When the Other Person Is Targeting You Instead of the Idea

Redirect them to the idea and hold that redirection. "I hear that you find this approach frustrating. Let's focus on the specific concern: you said it assumes stable requirements. Is that the core issue?" Move the conversation from identity territory to idea territory, and keep it there. Do not take the bait of responding to personal framing with personal defense — that validates the frame and escalates the exchange.

## Diagnostic Questions for the NUP Scan

Use these to assess NUP1 status when analyzing a project situation:

- Is the methodology being discussed as identity ("We ARE Agile, we don't do Waterfall") or as a tool ("We use Agile approaches because our requirements are uncertain")?
- Are team debates focused on results and outcomes, or on defending methodology positions?
- When was the last time the team incorporated a practice or idea from a methodology they don't currently use? What was the result?
- Is there resistance to specific practices or ideas simply because they come from a different methodology camp, without evaluating the practices on their own merits?
- Do team members feel pressure to conform to a single approach, or is there genuine openness to combining elements that fit the project context?
- When the current approach produces a poor outcome, what explanation does the team reach for first — method-context mismatch, or external factors?

A Green NUP1 signal: methodology is discussed as a tool, different approaches are evaluated on merit, team debates focus on results, practitioners can name contexts where their preferred method would be a poor choice.

A Yellow NUP1 signal: some identity language around methodology, mild resistance to outside ideas, but the team can still evaluate approaches on merit when pressed.

A Red NUP1 signal: methodology is primary identity, critique of the approach is treated as personal attack, ideas from outside the adopted method are reflexively dismissed, debates are about winning rather than finding the best approach.

## Methodology Cross-References

NUPP is not the only system that recognizes the risk of rigid affiliation. Each major methodology has internal provisions that support openness — though these provisions are sometimes ignored in practice because tribal identity overrides them.

**PRINCE2**: The "Tailor to suit the project" principle explicitly states that PRINCE2 must be adapted to the specific project environment. A PRINCE2 practitioner who applies the full framework without tailoring is violating a core PRINCE2 principle — yet this is often framed as "following PRINCE2 properly." Correct PRINCE2 application requires ongoing judgment about what to include, exclude, or modify. This is structurally anti-tribal: you cannot be a tribal PRINCE2 practitioner and also be applying the tailoring principle correctly.

**Scrum**: Sprint Retrospectives are designed to examine and improve the process itself — including the Scrum process. A team whose Retrospectives only address execution issues but never question whether Scrum is the right frame for their work is not fully applying Scrum. The retrospective is meant to be a space where the process itself is subject to critique.

**PMBOK**: The Knowledge Areas in PMBOK describe WHAT needs to be managed (scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, etc.) — they are neutral containers, not prescriptions for how. PMBOK does not mandate a lifecycle. A PMBOK-informed project can be predictive, iterative, or hybrid. Treating PMBOK as synonymous with "waterfall" is a misreading that tribalism reinforces.

**P3.express**: Designed from the outset to be compatible with other methods. It explicitly positions itself as a lightweight meta-system that can coexist with Scrum, PRINCE2, or other approaches. This is structural anti-tribalism baked into the design philosophy.

**XP (Extreme Programming)**: XP values include communication, feedback, simplicity, courage, and respect. "Courage" in XP explicitly includes the courage to change direction when evidence demands it — courage to abandon a practice that isn't working, even a core XP practice. "Feedback" requires genuine openness to information that contradicts current assumptions. These values are anti-tribal by definition: you cannot hold XP values and simultaneously be closed to evidence that an XP practice is not serving your team.

## Anti-patterns

### "We don't do Waterfall here"

Categorical rejection of predictive approaches without evaluating project context. Some projects genuinely benefit from upfront planning, stable scope definition, and sequential execution: infrastructure projects with well-understood specifications, regulatory compliance projects where all requirements are legally defined, projects where the cost of iteration is prohibitively high (hardware manufacturing, construction). A team that reflexively rejects predictive planning "because we're Agile" is making a method-selection decision on tribal grounds rather than on project needs. The anti-pattern is audible in the framing: "we don't do" as a statement of identity rather than "we've found that iterative works better for our typical projects."

### "That's not how we do things"

Dismissing ideas because they originate outside the team's adopted methodology, without evaluating the idea on its merits. The diagnosis: the reasoning ends at "not how we do things" rather than continuing to "and here's the specific problem with this idea in our context." When the source of an idea is sufficient grounds for rejection — when "that's a PRINCE2 concept" or "that's how PMPs think about it" is treated as a substantive rebuttal — affiliation is functioning as a filter that blocks evaluation on merit.

### Certification-as-Identity

Defining professional worth by certification held rather than by project results delivered. The pattern: practitioners identify primarily as "PMP," "PRINCE2 Practitioner," "Certified Scrum Master" and evaluate peers by certification status rather than by track record. Certifications are evidence of studied knowledge — they are not guarantees of competence, and they are not measures of project outcomes. A project that failed under a heavily-certified PM was still a failure. A project that succeeded under an uncertified PM with deep practical knowledge was still a success. Treating certification as the primary professional identity imports the tribal structure of the certifying body into professional judgment.

### Method Evangelism

Spending more energy promoting a methodology than delivering project outcomes. The diagnostic: the PM spends significant meeting time, stakeholder communication, and team interaction on explaining and selling the methodology rather than on the project itself. The methodology becomes the purpose instead of the means. A related form: publishing internal case studies about how well the team follows a methodology, rather than about what the methodology enabled the project to deliver. The methodology exists to serve the project. When attention inverts — when the project exists to demonstrate the methodology — the affiliation has displaced the purpose.
