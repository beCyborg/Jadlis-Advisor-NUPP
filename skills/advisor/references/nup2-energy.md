# NUP2: Preserve and Optimize Energy and Resources

## Context

Consult this reference when:
- The NUP Scan flagged NUP2 as Yellow or Red
- A PM or team leader appears to be making decisions that could be delegated
- The team is working consistent overtime
- There are interpersonal conflicts draining productivity
- Meetings seem excessive relative to their value
- A manager is involved in every small decision
- The team looks burned out, disengaged, or unmotivated
- The user is selecting a PM methodology and wants to understand how it handles resource and energy concerns

NUP2 addresses something that most PM methodologies acknowledge in scattered practices but never unify: the fact that mental energy, decision bandwidth, and human motivation are finite resources — as real and as exhaustible as budget or schedule.

## The Principle

Resources are limited. This includes the obvious project resources (budget, time, personnel), but NUPP extends the scope to something less frequently managed: mental energy — both yours as the PM and the collective energy of the team.

The principle has two directions:
1. **Preserve** — do not spend energy where it is not needed
2. **Optimize** — use it where it produces the greatest return

This is not a "take care of yourself" lifestyle tip bolted onto a PM framework. It is a structural recognition that decision quality degrades, trust erodes, and output drops when energy is poorly allocated. A PM who ignores this will gradually impair the project — not through bad intentions, but through predictable depletion.

## The 80/20 Rule Applied to Project Work

A large portion of PM value comes from a small portion of effort. NUPP applies the Pareto principle not just to deliverables, but to the PM work itself: documentation, planning, reporting, risk management, communication.

The critical implication is this: targeting 100% of possible benefit is expensive, and often unjustifiable. If 20% of risk management effort reduces 80% of risk, spending five times more effort to reduce the remaining 20% may be a poor trade. The same logic applies to:

- **Documentation**: A two-page project brief covering scope, objectives, and key decisions may deliver 80% of the value of a 40-page specification.
- **Reporting**: A weekly one-paragraph status update may deliver more useful information than a comprehensive dashboard that nobody reads.
- **Planning**: A rough milestone plan with defined assumptions often produces better outcomes than a detailed Gantt chart that becomes obsolete by week two.

Apply this lens when evaluating any PM activity. Ask: "What percentage of the benefit are we getting from this effort? What would we lose if we cut this in half?"

This does not mean being lazy or cutting corners. It means being deliberate about where intensity is justified.

## Decision Fatigue

Every decision — large or small, important or trivial — draws from the same reservoir of mental energy. This is not a metaphor. Research on decision fatigue shows that decision quality deteriorates over the course of a day, as more decisions are made. The same mental energy source powers decisions AND willpower.

The implication for project management is direct: a PM who makes 30 minor decisions before noon has less cognitive capacity for the risk escalation call at 2pm. A team that debates every formatting convention in their backlog grooming session will bring less sharpness to the architecture trade-off discussion that follows.

Micro-management is the organizational manifestation of this problem. When a PM routes all decisions through themselves — approving every task assignment, reviewing every document before it can move, signing off on every stakeholder email — they drain two things simultaneously:
1. Their own decision energy
2. The team's autonomy and motivation

PRINCE2's "manage by exception" principle is a direct structural solution to decision fatigue. Define tolerances for each level of authority (time, cost, scope, risk, quality, benefit). As long as work proceeds within those tolerances, the next level up is not involved. Only escalate when a tolerance is forecast to be breached. This keeps decision-making at the level where the information lives, and protects management-level decision energy for decisions that actually require it.

Practical application: identify the decisions you made last week. Categorize them as "only I could make this" versus "someone else could have made this with a clear delegation." If the second category is large, the micro-management pattern is present.

## Conflicts: Interpersonal vs. Idea-Level

Not all conflict is equal. NUPP draws a sharp distinction:

- **Conflicts about ideas** — debates about approach, prioritization, design, process — can be productive. They surface assumptions, improve decisions, and often lead to better outcomes than uncontested consensus.
- **Conflicts about people** — blame, personal criticism, political maneuvering, status battles — are almost always harmful. They drain mental energy from everyone involved AND from those who observe them, they erode trust, and they redirect cognitive capacity away from the project.

A PM who notices interpersonal conflict and decides to "let it sort itself out" is allowing a slow energy drain to continue unchecked. People conflicts rarely self-resolve. They tend to calcify, spread, and eventually surface in project outcomes: missed commitments, passive resistance, knowledge hoarding.

The diagnostic question is: is this conflict about what we should do, or about who is right? If the latter, intervene at the root cause — not the symptoms.

## Take Care of Yourself

NUPP is explicit that PM self-care is not peripheral to project success — it is structurally necessary.

Decisions and willpower consume mental energy. Sleep, food, and rest replenish it. Physical activity may help (research is ongoing, but the direction is positive). The consequence for project work is straightforward: a PM who is depleted makes worse decisions, communicates less clearly, and has less capacity to absorb and respond to the inevitable surprises that projects generate.

This is not a soft principle. A PM operating on four hours of sleep during a critical release week is a risk factor. A PM who skips lunch and takes back-to-back meetings for eight hours is gradually impairing the asset they rely on most: their judgment.

Self-management here means:
- Protecting sleep as a non-negotiable input to decision quality
- Blocking time for recovery, not just for tasks
- Recognizing the symptoms of depletion in yourself before they reach the project

## Sustainable Pace

The team must work at a pace that can be maintained without accumulating a deficit. NUPP and XP (which has "sustainable pace" as an explicit principle) agree on the mechanism: short-term overtime appears to help — you get more output this week — but it creates a deficit that compounds. Recovery time follows. Error rates increase. Motivation erodes.

The harder problem is that overtime often becomes habitual before anyone notices. A culture of "we always crunch at the end" normalizes the unsustainable. By the time the consequences are visible, the pattern is entrenched.

Practical levers:
- If you control the work environment and have discretion over provisions, offer food and snacks during intensive work periods. This is a small, evidence-supported way to help maintain physical energy during high-demand windows.
- Treat overtime as a warning signal, not a scheduling tool. If overtime is required to meet commitments, the commitments were wrong — examine the planning, not the team's work hours.
- Scrum's sprint cadence is partly a mechanism for sustainable pace: fixed-length iterations with a retrospective create a natural rhythm and a regular opportunity to surface pace-related problems before they become chronic.

## Work-Life Balance

Optimizing for project performance at the expense of personal life is not a trade-off with a good return. NUPP's position is that happier people perform better at work — and the evidence across organizations supports this. Chronic overwork produces diminishing returns followed by negative returns.

The PM's role in this is both personal and managerial:
- Personal: apply the same 80/20 logic to your own personal life that you apply to project work. More is not always better.
- Managerial: actively encourage team members to maintain balance. Not just "you're allowed to" but treating balance as a legitimate professional expectation.

Teams where members feel they must always be available, always appear busy, and always prioritize work over life tend to burn through their members without building resilience or loyalty.

## Motivation

Motivation is one of the most studied and most misunderstood topics in organizational psychology. NUPP acknowledges this complexity and provides two concrete guidelines.

First: continuous learning about motivation is itself a source of return. The more a PM understands what actually drives people (as opposed to what managers traditionally assume drives people), the more they can structure the environment to increase collective energy.

Second: recognition works. Simple acknowledgment — "thank you," "you handled that well," "I want the team to know what you did on this" — costs nothing and has measurable positive impact on motivation and trust.

The critical warning: many common motivational interventions for knowledge work have a negative effect. Small monetary rewards, contests, and prizes tend to:
- Reduce intrinsic motivation (the drive that comes from the work itself)
- Create competition where collaboration would produce better results
- Signal that the work is a means to the reward, rather than valuable in itself

This is counterintuitive and frequently ignored. Organizations implement bonus schemes and gift card programs because they feel like they should work. For repetitive manual tasks, extrinsic rewards can be effective. For knowledge work — which is what most project teams do — the research consistently points in the opposite direction. Intrinsic motivation (autonomy, mastery, purpose) outperforms extrinsic motivation (rewards, prizes, financial incentives).

## Collaboration and Teamwork

Collaboration can produce outcomes better than individual experts working in isolation. Humans are social animals; most people find genuine satisfaction in being part of a group that works well together. This social energy, when channeled productively, becomes a resource the project can draw on.

The PM's role is to remove the negative aspects — friction, confusion about roles, interpersonal conflicts, unclear norms — and create an environment where collaboration is pleasant rather than draining.

The important qualifier: not everyone thrives in constant group work. Some people produce their best work in focused, solitary conditions. A good team environment accommodates both modes — collaborative when collaboration adds value, focused and quiet when deep individual work is required.

## One-Team Culture

In most projects, distinct subgroups naturally form: business stakeholders and technical team members, client side and vendor side, senior and junior, permanent staff and contractors. These groups develop their own perspectives, vocabulary, and loyalties. Over time, this produces an "us vs. them" dynamic that consumes energy on both sides.

The business team believes the technical team doesn't understand priorities. The technical team believes the business team doesn't understand constraints. Each spends energy in meetings and conversations managing that tension — energy that is not going into the project.

Building a one-team culture means:
- Creating shared vocabulary and shared goals that cross the subgroup boundaries
- Structuring communication so that "business" and "technical" are roles, not camps
- Intervening when language starts to signal tribal division ("they want us to," "the business people think")
- Ensuring that the project's success criteria are genuinely shared across all subgroups, not owned by one side

## Wisdom of Crowds

When diverse people work together in a well-facilitated environment, they tend to produce better results than any single expert working alone. This is the wisdom of crowds effect, and it has a direct application in project management.

Practically: when you face a difficult problem, bring it to the team. Not to have them make the decision for you, but to draw on perspectives you don't have. This works best when:
- The question is genuinely open (not a decision already made that needs validation)
- The facilitation is neutral (not leading toward a preferred answer)
- All participants have room to contribute, not just the most senior voices

The secondary benefit is significant: people who are asked to help solve important problems feel appreciated and important. This increases their engagement and energy. The P3.express E02 activity operationalizes this directly — it uses structured group facilitation to surface team knowledge and input on project challenges.

## Chief Project Facilitator

A direct application of NUP2 to the PM role itself: most of what a PM does is facilitation — bringing people together, structuring conversations, helping groups reach decisions, removing obstacles so work can proceed. The title "Project Manager" implies command and control, which shapes how team members relate to the role.

When teams have had negative experiences with controlling, micromanaging PMs, they arrive at new projects in threat-detection mode. They spend energy analyzing whether this PM is safe to be honest with, whether admitting a problem will be punished, whether their judgment is trusted. This is energy not going into the project.

One concrete NUPP suggestion: consider calling the role "Chief Project Facilitator." This is not purely semantic. The title signals intent, reshapes expectations, and reduces the friction that comes from preloaded negative associations with "manager." Less friction means more energy available for the work.

## Diagnostic Questions for NUP2

Use these during a NUP Scan when assessing Energy:

- Is the PM making decisions that could and should be delegated?
- Are there interpersonal conflicts draining team energy? Are they being addressed or ignored?
- Is the team working overtime consistently? Is overtime normalized as a scheduling tool?
- Are meetings producing outcomes proportional to the time they consume?
- Is there evidence of decision fatigue? (Poor decisions late in the day, slow escalation of obvious problems, avoidance of hard choices)
- Are team members recognized for their contributions in ways that actually increase intrinsic motivation?
- Is there an "us vs. them" dynamic between any subgroups? What is it costing?
- Are there activities that consume energy without clear connection to project outcomes?

## Methodology Cross-References

| Methodology | NUP2 Coverage |
|-------------|--------------|
| PRINCE2 | "Manage by exception" directly addresses decision fatigue and delegation. Tolerances are the structural mechanism. |
| Scrum | Sprint cadence creates sustainable rhythm. Retrospectives surface energy drains. Daily standups keep communication efficient. |
| XP | "Sustainable pace" is an explicit principle. The 40-hour week rule is a direct NUP2 implementation. |
| P3.express | E02 activity uses wisdom of crowds. Designed to be lightweight, directly applying 80/20 to PM overhead. |
| PMBOK | Resource management knowledge area covers the physical and human resource dimensions. Less explicit on mental energy. |
| DSDM | MoSCoW prioritization reduces decision load. Timeboxing creates sustainable rhythm. |

## Anti-patterns

### The Hero PM

The PM who handles everything personally: all decisions flow through them, all documents need their approval, all stakeholder calls are theirs. They work 12-14 hour days and consider this a sign of dedication.

The short-term appearance is high output. The actual effect is threefold:
1. Decision fatigue accumulates — each day the PM's judgment is slightly worse than it could have been
2. The team's autonomy and competence atrophies — they stop trying to solve problems because they know it will be reviewed and overridden
3. The PM becomes a single point of failure — any absence creates a crisis

Manage by exception. Define tolerances. Delegate with clear authority boundaries. The PM's job is to ensure the project succeeds, not to personally execute every part of it.

### Meeting Mania

Calendars filled with recurring meetings — daily syncs, weekly status calls, bi-weekly alignment sessions, monthly reviews — designed to "stay aligned." Each meeting consumes energy from every person in the room, who could otherwise be doing the work the meetings are supposedly about.

Apply 80/20 ruthlessly: which meetings produce 80% of the alignment value? Start there. Audit the rest for purpose (NUP5 applies here too). A meeting without a clear decision to make or a specific problem to solve is a cost with unclear benefit.

The diagnostic signal: if people are doing other work during a meeting, the meeting is not worth their full attention. That is information about the meeting's value, not about the team's professionalism.

### The Monetary Motivation Trap

Introducing bonuses, prizes, gift cards, or other financial incentives to motivate a knowledge work team. This feels like a straightforward intervention — people like money, so reward good performance with money.

The research outcome is consistent: for knowledge work, this approach reduces intrinsic motivation. The team begins to optimize for the metric that drives the reward rather than for the outcome the reward was designed to incentivize. Collaboration decreases as individuals compete for the prize. The work itself becomes less interesting because it is now instrumentalized.

Recognition costs nothing and works. "Thank you" in front of the team, publicly acknowledging someone's contribution to a difficult problem, explicitly noting in a retrospective that someone's initiative made a difference — these build intrinsic motivation. They signal that the person matters, not just the output.

### Ignoring Conflict Signals

Noticing early signs of interpersonal tension — a sharpened exchange in a meeting, a passive-aggressive comment in a document review, two team members avoiding each other — and categorizing it as "they'll work it out."

People conflicts rarely self-resolve. Without intervention, the energy drain grows quietly until it becomes visible in project outcomes: deadlines missed because two people aren't sharing information, work duplicated because someone didn't want to ask the other person a question, a team member going quiet in meetings where previously they were engaged.

The PM who intervenes early — not to adjudicate blame but to name the dynamic and redirect it — prevents a small drain from becoming a structural problem. The intervention does not require a confrontation; it often requires only naming the pattern and creating a space where the root cause can be discussed without escalation.
