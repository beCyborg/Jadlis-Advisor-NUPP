# NUP5: Don't Do Anything Without a Clear Purpose

## Context

Read this file when the NUP Scan flags NUP5 as Yellow or Red, or when the user's situation involves any of the following:

- The team is performing activities, producing documents, or running meetings without a clear rationale for why
- A project has heavy template usage where templates are filled in by default rather than by deliberate choice
- Status reports are long and detailed but stakeholders remain confused about project health
- Monitoring tracks many metrics but the data is not informing any specific decisions
- A business case or project charter was created at initiation and has not been referenced since
- A process or ceremony is continued because "that is how we do it" rather than because it serves an identifiable need
- The team cannot articulate what problem the project is solving — only what the project is building
- Post-project review is skipped because the project is "done"

This reference gives Claude the NUPP-specific framework for purpose-driven project work. Claude's general training covers purposefulness conceptually, but does not include the NUPP diagnostic patterns — the parallel worlds test, the hierarchy of monitoring drivers, the two-report approach, or the elevator mirror as a structural lesson about confusing assumed solutions with actual purposes.

## The Principle

NUP5 states: **Don't do anything without a clear purpose.**

This is deceptively simple. The difficulty is not in agreeing with it — everyone agrees. The difficulty is in applying it consistently when the pressure to conform to established patterns is high, when there is a template available, when the process is inherited from a previous project, or when stopping to ask "why are we doing this?" feels like obstruction.

NUP5 holds that without a clear purpose, an activity either provides no benefit at all, or is executed in a way that fails to realize its potential benefit. The document exists but serves no one. The meeting happens but produces no useful output. The metric is tracked but informs no decision. The business case is filed and never consulted.

The corrective is not to eliminate activities, documents, and processes — it is to derive them from purpose rather than from convention. When you know why something exists, you know how to design it, how much effort to invest in it, and when to stop doing it.

## The Parallel Worlds Test

The practical test for NUP5 compliance: imagine two parallel worlds where everything is identical except for the activity, document, or process you are evaluating. In World A, you do it. In World B, you don't. How different are those two worlds?

If you cannot articulate a meaningful difference, the activity likely lacks a real purpose. If you can articulate the difference clearly, you have just defined the purpose, and you can use that definition to design the activity appropriately.

The test applies at every level:

- **For a meeting**: In World B where this meeting doesn't happen, what decisions get made differently, or more slowly, or not at all?
- **For a document**: In World B where this document isn't prepared, what would be missing from someone's understanding, and what would go wrong as a result?
- **For a process**: In World B where this process doesn't exist, what errors or misalignments would occur that it currently prevents?
- **For an entire project**: In World B where this project is never initiated, what problem remains unsolved?

When the answer is "not much," the activity needs to be redesigned or dropped. When the answer is "significant difference," you have a purpose statement you can use to decide what form the activity should take and how much effort it deserves.

The parallel worlds test is the ultimate check for any project activity. If you can't articulate the difference, the activity likely lacks purpose.

## Portfolio vs Project Purpose

NUP5 operates at two levels that interact in important ways.

**Portfolio management** is about doing the right things — selecting which projects to initiate, fund, and prioritize. It is a purpose filter at the organizational level.

**Project management** is about doing things right — executing the selected work effectively. It is a purpose filter at the operational level.

A critical asymmetry: it does not matter how well you execute a project if the project itself is solving the wrong problem. Excellent execution of a purposeless project is still waste. Portfolio-level purpose must remain visible throughout execution, not just at approval gates.

Most project failures involve purpose problems at one level or the other: projects initiated without a clear articulation of what benefit will result; projects executed with process overhead that consumes resources without improving outcomes; activities performed within projects because the methodology requires them, not because the project needs them.

NUP5 demands that purpose be explicit at every level, and that each level be checked regularly — not just at initiation.

## The Elevator Mirror Example

This is the canonical illustration of NUP5 in project contexts.

A building owner receives persistent complaints that the elevators are too slow. Multiple projects are initiated: elevator modernization, control system upgrades, scheduling algorithm improvements. These are delivered with reasonable competence. Complaints decrease somewhat but continue.

Eventually someone refocuses on the actual problem. Tenants are not suffering because elevators are slow in an engineering sense — they are suffering because waiting for an elevator is boring and uncomfortable. Faster elevators are an assumed solution, not the purpose.

When the focus shifts to the purpose (reduce the discomfort of waiting), a different solution becomes obvious: install mirrors in the elevator lobbies. People waiting near mirrors stop noticing the wait. Complaints drop to near zero at a fraction of the cost of any modernization project.

NUP5 lessons from this example:

**The assumed solution is not the purpose.** "We need faster elevators" has already selected a solution. Asking "what problem will faster elevators solve?" reveals the actual purpose — which may be achievable by very different means.

**Projects launched against assumed solutions ignore alternatives.** Once the team is committed to "elevator speed improvement," mirrors are invisible — they don't fit the project's framing. Purpose-first thinking keeps the solution space open until the problem is genuinely understood.

**Purpose alignment changes the definition of success.** If the project is "improve elevator speed," mirrors are a distraction. If the project is "reduce tenant discomfort during elevator waits," mirrors are an excellent solution. The purpose statement determines what counts as a win.

**Simple solutions become visible when purpose is clear.** Purpose-driven projects regularly find simpler, cheaper solutions because they are not constrained to execute the assumed solution.

This is also why "looking for a template is the opposite of doing something based on purpose." A template assumes the solution. Purpose-first work asks what the project actually needs.

## Project as a Whole — Purpose Alignment

The product a project delivers varies in how flexible its final form is. In IT and software, the product may be almost completely open — an Agile team starts with a rough vision and discovers the final form through iteration. In construction or regulatory compliance, the product is largely specified at initiation. In both cases, keeping the ultimate purpose visible is critical.

Elements that support purpose alignment across project types:

- **Documented purpose, accessible to the team**: Scrum's product vision, PRINCE2's business case, PMBOK's benefits management plan — these serve the same function from different angles. The format matters less than whether the document is actively used.
- **Regular reference to the justification**: P3.express includes weekly review of business justification precisely because purpose drift is a known failure mode in longer projects.
- **Understanding both client and supplier purposes**: When delivering for an external client, the client has their own purpose for commissioning the work; your organization has its own purpose for taking the contract. Both are valid; neither can be ignored.

## Project Monitoring — Purpose-Driven Metrics

Monitoring produces data. Data has a cost. NUP5 asks: what is the purpose of collecting this specific data?

NUPP describes a hierarchy of monitoring drivers based on ultimate purpose:

1. **Justification and benefits** — the ultimate reason the project exists, expressed as expected outcomes and benefits
2. **Explicit and implicit targets for project variables** — time, cost, quality, scope parameters
3. **Low-level monitoring data** — raw measurements collected from ongoing work

The purpose of all monitoring is to determine whether the project is on track to deliver the justification and benefits. Low-level data exists to calculate forecasts that enable that determination.

**The appropriate measurement is the forecast at completion.** When will we finish? What will the total cost be? A project that is 40% complete and 5% over budget does not tell a decision-maker whether it will finish on time and within budget. Only a completion forecast does that. Planned versus actual values to date are inputs to the forecast — they are not the output.

**Each metric should be traceable to a decision it informs.** If a metric changes, does any decision change? If not, the metric has no purpose. This applies to every field in every status report, every tracking spreadsheet, every dashboard widget.

## Documents — Purpose Over Templates

Planning is always necessary. The question NUP5 asks is not whether to plan, but what level of detail each plan type requires given the project's actual purposes.

Too little detail means the plan cannot support holistic decision-making. Too much means it is costly to prepare, painful to maintain, quickly becomes unrealistic, and is ignored.

The best way to determine the right level: have a purpose for every element.

- How will this element help the project?
- How much effort will preparing and maintaining it require?
- Is it worth it?

**Looking for a template and filling it in is the opposite of doing something based on purpose.** The template becomes the specification. Elements exist because the template contains them, not because the project needs them.

Templates are useful as checklists of what has been valuable on previous projects — inputs to the purpose conversation, not replacements for it. The right process: understand the real purpose of the document type, consult resources like PRINCE2, PMBOK, P3.express, or DSDM to see what elements are commonly useful and why, then evaluate each element against this project's needs. The document that results may look very different from any template. That is correct.

## Status Reporting — Two Purposes

Long status reports are common. They are often useless for the stated purpose of helping stakeholders understand project health.

NUP5 applied: what is the purpose of this report?

If the answer is "helping stakeholders understand the current situation and make decisions," a well-structured one-page report will almost always serve that purpose better than a twenty-page one. The twenty-page report buries the signal in noise and leads to selective reading that misses critical information.

But a second purpose often operates alongside the first: satisfying governance compliance expectations, creating an audit trail, or meeting contractual reporting requirements. This second purpose is real and cannot be ignored.

The NUP5 solution when two distinct purposes exist: create two reports, and do not merge them.

- A short report (one page, clearly structured) for actual stakeholder understanding and decision support
- A longer, detailed report satisfying governance, audit, or contractual expectations

Both serve their purposes. Neither is compromised by trying to serve the other's. Trying to write a single report that serves both typically produces a document that serves neither — too long for easy stakeholder comprehension, too informal for governance compliance.

## Business Case and Project Charter

These documents are widely experienced as bureaucratic necessities: boxes to check before work can begin, obligations rather than tools.

This experience is almost always the result of template-driven preparation. The document does not reflect genuine thinking about the project's purpose, risks, or alternatives — it reflects the template structure. Naturally, it provides no value once filed.

NUP5 reframes these documents: they have valid purposes that apply to most projects.

- **Business case**: articulate why the organization should commit resources; define what success looks like in terms the organization cares about; provide a reference point for ongoing justification checks; enable Go/No-Go decisions when circumstances change
- **Project charter**: establish shared understanding of scope, authority, constraints, and objectives; align stakeholders before work begins; provide a reference for resolving scope disputes

The test for whether a business case is purpose-driven: if circumstances change mid-project (costs increase, expected benefits decrease, a competitor launches a similar product), does the team know how to use the business case to evaluate whether to continue? If yes, the document served its purpose. If no one knows where the document is, the preparation effort was wasted.

## Post-Project Purpose

The NUP5 question applies after delivery too: what is the purpose of post-project activities?

Two distinct purposes apply:

**Learning**: understanding how well the project's ultimate goals were actually achieved produces lessons that improve future project selection and execution. This requires measuring outcomes after delivery — after the product has been in use long enough for benefits to materialize. Measuring immediately at delivery captures outputs (what was built), not outcomes (what changed as a result).

**Ongoing monitoring**: some projects deliver products that require monitoring to detect whether expected benefits are being realized and to trigger corrective action if they are not. This responsibility belongs primarily to program and portfolio management.

Post-project review is neglected in many organizations because program and portfolio management layers are absent. The project team disperses, and no one tracks whether the thing they built actually worked. This is a systemic purpose failure: the organization invests in projects without closing the loop on whether those investments delivered value. P3.express and DSDM explicitly add post-project steps to address this gap.

## Simplicity and Tailoring

NUP5 has a direct implication for system design: simple systems usually work better than complex ones.

The world is complex, but our models are abstract approximations — not replicas. Adding complexity hoping to match the world's complexity produces systems that are hard to use and hard to focus. The complexity becomes the obstacle.

When purposes are clear, simplicity becomes achievable — you know what each element must do, so you know when an element can be removed without loss. Complexity accumulates when purpose is unclear, because no one is sure whether removing something would cause harm.

This connects directly to tailoring. A software startup, a hospital managing device certification, a construction company building a fire station — radically different conditions, different purposes, different systems needed. When the purposes of each PM system element are understood, tailoring becomes natural and justified. Tailoring without purpose understanding is guessing. Tailoring with purpose understanding is engineering.

## Diagnostic Questions (for NUP Scan)

Apply these when evaluating a project for NUP5 compliance:

- Can the project team clearly articulate the ultimate purpose of the project — not what it is building, but what problem it is solving?
- For each major activity, document, and process: what happens in the parallel world where this doesn't exist? Is the difference significant and clearly articulable?
- Are reports and documents designed from their purpose, or prepared from templates?
- Are monitoring metrics tracking forecasts at completion, or collecting data without a clear decision they inform?
- Is the business case or project charter actively referenced during the project, or filed at initiation?
- Are there activities that once had a purpose but whose purpose has since changed or disappeared?

## Methodology Cross-References

- **PRINCE2**: "Continued business justification" principle (justification checked throughout, not just at initiation); "Business Case" theme; "Focus on products" principle
- **Scrum**: Product Vision; Sprint Goal (the purpose of each sprint beyond the task list); Definition of Done (purpose-driven quality criteria)
- **PMBOK**: Business case; benefits management plan; project charter; stakeholder engagement driven by understanding stakeholder purposes
- **P3.express**: Post-project activity; weekly business justification review built into the process rhythm
- **DSDM**: Business Case as a living document; MoSCoW prioritization as a purpose-driven scope management tool

## Anti-patterns

### Template Culture

Finding a template and filling it in for every document. The template becomes the specification; the project's actual needs are secondary. Elements exist because the template contains them, not because the project needs them. The resulting document consumes effort to prepare but is not used during execution.

The NUP5 corrective: understand why the document type exists. What decisions should it support? What shared understanding should it create? Design the document to serve those purposes in whatever form works best. Consult templates as checklists of what might be relevant — not as the specification.

### Data Collection Without Direction

Tracking metrics because "a well-managed project should track these things" without knowing what decisions the data will inform. If a metric changes from Red to Green and no decision changes, no action changes, and no communication changes — the metric has no purpose. The effort of collecting, verifying, and reporting it is wasted.

The NUP5 corrective: for each metric, name the decision it informs. If no decision is named, the metric should not be tracked until one is identified.

### Zombie Processes

Activities that once had a valid purpose, but whose purpose has since changed or disappeared. Still performed because they are established practice, because stopping them would require explanation, or because "we've always done it this way." The effort is real; the benefit is gone.

The NUP5 corrective: apply the parallel worlds test periodically to standing processes, not just at initiation. If removing the process leaves the two worlds indistinguishable, the process has become a zombie. Modify it to restore its purpose, or retire it.

### Purpose Amnesia

Starting a project with a clear and well-documented purpose, then gradually losing sight of it as day-to-day operational details take over. The team becomes focused on delivering the work rather than delivering the outcome. Scope decisions are made based on what is easy or what the client is currently asking for — rather than what will realize the original purpose.

Especially dangerous in long projects, where months of execution create distance from the original business case and the stakeholders who approved it may have moved on.

The NUP5 corrective: make the purpose visible and keep it visible. P3.express's weekly business justification review is one structural approach. PRINCE2's exception-based management with stage boundaries forces regular purpose revalidation. Whatever mechanism is used, the purpose must be a living reference, not an archived document.
